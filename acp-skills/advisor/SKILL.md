# Advisor Strategy for Claude Code

## Overview

The Advisor Strategy pairs a high-capability model (Claude Opus 4.6) as a strategic advisor with the current executor model (Sonnet/Haiku) for day-to-day work. The executor handles primary tasks end-to-end. When facing decisions it cannot confidently resolve, it consults the advisor for guidance, code review, architectural direction, or debugging insight.

**Core principle:** Escalate to a stronger model when the stakes justify it — don't guess when you can consult.

**Origin:** Based on [Anthropic's Advisor Strategy](https://claude.com/blog/the-advisor-strategy) for the Messages API, adapted for Claude Code's Agent tool.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph advisor_trigger {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=diamond];
    
    "Task received" [shape=ellipse];
    "User explicitly\nrequests advisor?" -> "INVOKE ADVISOR" [label="yes"];
    "User explicitly\nrequests advisor?" -> "Complex architectural\ndecision?" [label="no"];
    "Complex architectural\ndecision?" -> "INVOKE ADVISOR" [label="yes"];
    "Complex architectural\ndecision?" -> "Stuck debugging\n> 2 attempts?" [label="no"];
    "Stuck debugging\n> 2 attempts?" -> "INVOKE ADVISOR" [label="yes"];
    "Stuck debugging\n> 2 attempts?" -> "High-stakes or\nirreversible change?" [label="no"];
    "High-stakes or\nirreversible change?" -> "INVOKE ADVISOR" [label="yes"];
    "High-stakes or\nirreversible change?" -> "Security or\nperformance critical?" [label="no"];
    "Security or\nperformance critical?" -> "INVOKE ADVISOR" [label="yes"];
    "Security or\nperformance critical?" -> "Uncertain between\n2+ valid approaches?" [label="no"];
    "Uncertain between\n2+ valid approaches?" -> "INVOKE ADVISOR" [label="yes"];
    "Uncertain between\n2+ valid approaches?" -> "Context window\n> 60% used?" [label="no"];
    "Context window\n> 60% used?" -> "INVOKE ADVISOR\n(for summarization)" [label="yes"];
    "Context window\n> 60% used?" -> "PROCEED WITHOUT\nADVISOR" [label="no"];
    
    "Task received" -> "User explicitly\nrequests advisor?";
    "INVOKE ADVISOR" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#e8f5e9"];
    "INVOKE ADVISOR\n(for summarization)" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#e8f5e9"];
    "PROCEED WITHOUT\nADVISOR" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#fff3e0"];
}
```

### Explicit Triggers (user-initiated)
- "use advisor", "consult advisor", "get a second opinion"
- "ask opus", "escalate this", "I want the advisor on this"
- Mentioning a specific domain: "security review this", "architecture check"

### Autonomous Triggers (agent-initiated)
- **Architectural decisions**: System design, API design, database schema, major refactors
- **Debugging dead-ends**: Stuck after 2+ failed attempts, root cause unclear
- **High-stakes changes**: Production configs, auth systems, data migrations, CI/CD pipelines
- **Security-sensitive code**: Auth, crypto, input validation, permission systems
- **Performance-critical paths**: Hot loops, database queries, caching strategies
- **Trade-off decisions**: Multiple valid approaches, unclear which is best
- **Context management**: Conversation growing large, need to summarize and refocus

### When NOT to Use
- Simple, well-understood tasks (CRUD, boilerplate, formatting)
- Tasks where the answer is clearly documented
- When the user explicitly says not to use the advisor
- Trivial bug fixes with obvious causes

## Advisor Configuration

### Default Model

```
Model: opus (Claude Claude Opus 4.6)
Fallback: NONE — inform user and ask
```

**If Opus is unavailable**, tell the user:

> "The Opus advisor model is currently unavailable. I can continue without advisor consultation, but note that:
> - Complex architectural decisions may lack the depth of analysis an advisor provides
> - Security-sensitive reviews benefit from a second, more capable model
> - I may miss edge cases that the advisor would catch
>
> Would you like me to proceed with the current model, or wait until Opus is available?"

### Changing the Advisor Model

To use a different advisor model, tell the main agent:
- "use sonnet as advisor" or "advisor model: sonnet"
- This is useful when Opus is unavailable or for cost-conscious workflows

The model parameter maps to Claude Code's Agent tool `model` field:
- `opus` → Claude Claude Opus 4.6
- `sonnet` → Claude Claude Sonnet 4.6
- `haiku` → Claude Claude Haiku 4.5

## Domain Advisors

The advisor can be specialized by domain. Each domain advisor gets a tailored prompt that focuses its analysis.

### Available Domains

| Domain | Trigger Keywords | Focus |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Architecture** | "design", "structure", "refactor", "scale" | System design, patterns, modularity, extensibility |
| **Security** | "auth", "security", "vulnerability", "permissions" | OWASP top 10, auth flows, input validation, secrets |
| **Performance** | "slow", "optimize", "latency", "memory" | Profiling, caching, algorithmic complexity, DB queries |
| **Debugging** | "stuck", "failing", "can't figure out", "root cause" | Root cause analysis, hypothesis generation, test strategies |
| **Code Quality** | "review", "clean up", "best practice" | Readability, maintainability, testing, patterns |
| **Context Manager** | "summarize context", "context is large", auto-triggered | Distill conversation state, identify key decisions, compress |

### Auto-Detection

When invoking the advisor autonomously, detect the domain from context:

```dot
digraph domain_detection {
    "Advisor triggered" [shape=ellipse];
    "User specified\ndomain?" [shape=diamond];
    "Use specified domain" [shape=box];
    "Analyze problem\nkeywords" [shape=box];
    "Match domain\nfrom table" [shape=box];
    "Default to\ngeneral advisor" [shape=box];
    
    "Advisor triggered" -> "User specified\ndomain?";
    "User specified\ndomain?" -> "Use specified domain" [label="yes"];
    "User specified\ndomain?" -> "Analyze problem\nkeywords" [label="no"];
    "Analyze problem\nkeywords" -> "Match domain\nfrom table";
    "Match domain\nfrom table" -> "Default to\ngeneral advisor" [label="no match"];
}
```

## Context Management Protocol

**This is critical.** The advisor must receive focused context, not a raw dump.

### What to Send

```dot
digraph context_extraction {
    "Prepare advisor\ncontext" [shape=ellipse];
    "1. Problem statement\n(1-3 sentences)" [shape=box];
    "2. Relevant code\n(specific files/functions)" [shape=box];
    "3. What you tried\n(failed approaches)" [shape=box];
    "4. Constraints\n(tech stack, requirements)" [shape=box];
    "5. Specific question\nfor advisor" [shape=box];
    
    "Prepare advisor\ncontext" -> "1. Problem statement\n(1-3 sentences)";
    "1. Problem statement\n(1-3 sentences)" -> "2. Relevant code\n(specific files/functions)";
    "2. Relevant code\n(specific files/functions)" -> "3. What you tried\n(failed approaches)";
    "3. What you tried\n(failed approaches)" -> "4. Constraints\n(tech stack, requirements)";
    "4. Constraints\n(tech stack, requirements)" -> "5. Specific question\nfor advisor";
}
```

### What NOT to Send
- Full conversation history
- Irrelevant files or code
- Tool call logs
- Previous advisor responses (unless building on them)

### Context Budget
- **Problem statement**: Max 3 sentences
- **Code context**: Only the specific files/functions relevant (read them fresh, don't paste from memory)
- **Failed approaches**: Brief summary, not full debug logs
- **Constraints**: Only those that affect the decision

## How to Invoke the Advisor

### Step 1: Announce

Before invoking, tell the user what you're doing:

```
I'm consulting the **[Domain] Advisor** (Claude Opus 4.6) on [specific question].
```

### Step 2: Dispatch Sub-Agent

Use the Agent tool with these parameters:

```
Agent(
  description: "[Domain] advisor consultation"
  model: "opus"
  prompt: <structured prompt from templates below>
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `model: "opus"` (or configured model). The `"opus"` value is Claude Code's shorthand for Claude Opus 4.6 — this is the entire point of the skill: leveraging a more capable model for strategic decisions.

### Step 3: Present Response

Format the advisor's response for the user:

```markdown
---
**Advisor Response** ([Domain] · Claude Opus 4.6)

[Advisor's analysis and recommendations]

---
```

Then synthesize and continue:
```
Based on the advisor's analysis, I'll proceed with [chosen approach] because [reasoning].
```

- Rank hypotheses by likelihood
- For each hypothesis, suggest a specific diagnostic step
- If you need to read files to investigate, do so
- Look for: race conditions, state corruption, edge cases, environment differences
- Don't just confirm the executor's hypothesis — consider alternatives

  1. Hypothesis ranking (most likely first)
  2. Diagnostic steps for each
  3. Most likely root cause
  4. Suggested fix
  5. How to verify the fix
```

### Context Manager Advisor

```

[What the user is trying to accomplish]

## Key Decisions Made So Far
[Important decisions and their rationale]

## Current State
[Where things stand — what's done, what's pending]

## Active Problems
[Any unresolved issues or blockers]

## Instructions
- Distill the conversation into a compact summary
- Preserve: decisions, rationale, current state, pending work
- Discard: tool output details, exploration dead-ends, verbose logs
- Identify the critical context the executor needs going forward
- Structure your response as:
  1. Task summary (1-2 sentences)
  2. Key decisions (bulleted, with rationale)
  3. Current state (what's done, what's not)
  4. Pending work (prioritized)
  5. Critical context (anything the executor must not forget)
```

## Multi-Advisor Consultations

For complex problems spanning multiple domains, you can consult multiple advisors:

```dot
digraph multi_advisor {
    rankdir=LR;
    "Complex\nproblem" [shape=ellipse];
    "Identify\ndomains" [shape=box];
    "Dispatch advisors\nin parallel" [shape=box];
    "Security\nAdvisor" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#ffcdd2"];
    "Architecture\nAdvisor" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#c8e6c9"];
    "Performance\nAdvisor" [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor="#bbdefb"];
    "Synthesize\nresponses" [shape=box];
    "Present unified\nrecommendation" [shape=box];
    
    "Complex\nproblem" -> "Identify\ndomains";
    "Identify\ndomains" -> "Dispatch advisors\nin parallel";
    "Dispatch advisors\nin parallel" -> "Security\nAdvisor";
    "Dispatch advisors\nin parallel" -> "Architecture\nAdvisor";
    "Dispatch advisors\nin parallel" -> "Performance\nAdvisor";
    "Security\nAdvisor" -> "Synthesize\nresponses";
    "Architecture\nAdvisor" -> "Synthesize\nresponses";
    "Performance\nAdvisor" -> "Synthesize\nresponses";
    "Synthesize\nresponses" -> "Present unified\nrecommendation";
}
```

**To dispatch in parallel**, use multiple Agent tool calls in a single message, each with `model: "opus"` and the appropriate domain prompt.

**When synthesizing**, look for:
- Conflicts between advisors (security vs performance trade-offs)
- Reinforcing recommendations (multiple advisors agree)
- Gaps (something no advisor covered)

Present conflicts explicitly to the user for decision-making.

## Shared Decision-Making

The advisor provides analysis, but decisions flow through a structured process:

1. **Advisor provides analysis** with ranked recommendations
2. **Executor evaluates** against project constraints and user preferences
3. **Executor presents** advisor's recommendation + own assessment
4. **User decides** (or executor proceeds if autonomous mode)

```markdown
**Advisor recommends:** [Approach A] because [reasons]
**My assessment:** I agree/disagree because [context the advisor didn't have]
**Recommendation:** [Final recommendation]
**Proceeding with:** [Chosen approach] — let me know if you'd prefer otherwise.
```

## Token Budget Guidelines

| Component | Budget |
|-----------|--------|
| Problem statement | ~50-100 tokens |
| Code context | ~500-2000 tokens (read fresh, trim to relevant) |
| Failed approaches | ~100-200 tokens |
| Constraints | ~50-100 tokens |
| Advisor prompt template | ~200-400 tokens |
| **Total per consultation** | **~1000-3000 tokens input** |

**Rule of thumb:** If your advisor prompt exceeds 3000 tokens, you're sending too much context. Trim it.

## Edge Cases

### Main Agent Is Already Opus
If you're already running as Opus, the advisor pattern still has value:
- **Second opinion**: A fresh Opus instance without your conversation's cognitive load
- **Parallel analysis**: Dispatch advisor while you continue other work
- **Domain focus**: Advisor gets a clean, focused prompt without 100k tokens of prior context

### User Says "Don't Use Advisor"
Respect it. Do not consult the advisor. If you believe it's genuinely risky to proceed without one (e.g., security-critical auth), warn the user once:
> "I'll proceed without the advisor as requested. Note that auth code benefits from a second review — let me know if you change your mind."

Then proceed. Do not ask repeatedly.

### Advisor Disagrees With Your Analysis
Present both perspectives to the user:
```markdown
**Advisor recommends:** [Approach A] because [reasons]
**My assessment differs:** I lean toward [Approach B] because [reasons from conversation context]
**Key difference:** [What the advisor may not have seen vs. what you may have missed]
```

Let the user decide. Do not silently override the advisor.

## Rationalization Table

| Excuse for Skipping Advisor | Reality |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| "This is a standard pattern, I know this" | Standard patterns have standard vulnerabilities. 30s of advisor time prevents hours of debugging. |
| "The user said to be quick" | Speed pressure ≠ skip review. Make the consultation fast, not absent. |
| "I'll review it myself after" | Self-review catches less than fresh-eyes review. That's the whole point. |
| "It's just a small change" | Small auth/security changes cause the biggest breaches. |
| "The advisor will just agree with me" | Then the consultation costs 30s and confirms you're right. Worth it. |
| "I don't want to slow the user down" | Announce the consultation, dispatch, present — takes under a minute. |
| "I'm already on Opus, no point" | Fresh context + domain focus > exhausted context window. |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Sending full conversation to advisor | Extract only the relevant problem + code |
| Using advisor for trivial tasks | Only escalate when stakes/complexity justify it |
| Ignoring advisor recommendations silently | Always present advisor output to user |
| Not reading files fresh for advisor | Read the actual files, don't paste from earlier context |
| Forgetting to specify `model: "opus"` | The whole point is the more capable model |
| Over-consulting (every decision) | Trust your judgment for routine work |
| Under-consulting (never escalating) | When uncertain on high-stakes decisions, consult |
| Not announcing advisor invocation | Always tell the user before consulting |
| Raw-dumping advisor response | Synthesize — add your assessment and recommendation |

## Quick Reference

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Invoke advisor | `Agent(model: "opus", prompt: <template>)` |
| Specify domain | Use domain-specific prompt template |
| Multi-advisor | Multiple Agent calls in one message |
| Change model | User says "advisor model: sonnet" |
| Skip advisor | User says "don't use advisor" or "skip advisor" |
| Context management | Use Context Manager advisor template |
| Check availability | If Agent with opus fails, inform user with drawbacks |
